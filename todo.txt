----- QUESTIONS --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


----- ARCHITECTURE -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Set nullable false to mandatory entity attributes OR use hibernate validations
- Use config property loading from Spring instead of ConfigService
- Use property from config to set language of application
- Decide if cells with complex graphics should be defined in code or in fxml
- Create method for creating fxml loader with resource bundle in Main and use it in all places which creates FXML loader
\- Create application wide css file used by all FXML loaders, so some styles can be easily changed for whole app (like buttons size)
- Create custom component for MultiSelect, so MultiSelect does not need to hack underlying CheckComboBox
- Decide if IngredientQuantityTable should be in core components or in ingredient package and thus ComponentUtil has to provide public access
- Measure and optimize loading of tables
- Create FieldLable component which adds ':' automatically after internationalized text, so there can be only one variant in message properties.
- Clean up messages.properties so there are no duplicate words. Use common keys instead.
- Optimize filtering so items from database are already sorted. Optimize converting of entities to sorted set.
- Devise proper mechanism for FXML custom components

- low priority - try to use metamodel in criteria queries
